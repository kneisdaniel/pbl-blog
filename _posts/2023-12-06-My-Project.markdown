Hi! My name is Daniel Kneis and I currently visiting a 10-month Java programming course at [everyone codes](https://everyonecodes.io/). In order to practice our newly-gained skills in Java and Spring Boot, we had 6 weeks to work on a small project of our choice. As an anime fan, I decided to write a small Lexicon Project for Watchable anime in Austria. 

Thanks for reading my blog!
