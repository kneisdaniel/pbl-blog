Hello! My name is Daniel Kneis, and my preferences are anime and video games. In this blog, I will introduce you to my project and delve into some problems I encountered during its development. This project is part of a Java programming course offered by [everyone codes](https://everyonecodes.io/), and we had 6 weeks to complete it.

My project is a lexicon designed to help anime fans discover series available in Austria. To achieve this, I utilized Maven Spring Boot (software used: IntelliJ Idea), GIT and GitHub to track the project's progress, Json to read test data, PostgreSQL as the database, and JPA for data management.

Thanks for reading my blog!
